A list of books suggested by the security community to aid intelligence analysts learn to think
Intelligence analysts in the cybersecurity field often have a lot of experience with technical indicators, such as
IP addresses, file hashes or domain names. However, there is very little training in how to think like an analyst.

As cybersecurity becomes more complicated, both in the nature and scope of attacks as well the prominence that the 
cybersecurity team plays within an organization, it is imperative for analysts to be able to think clearly, understand
their biases, and effective communicate their position. 

This list of books is designed to help analysts refine their thinking and improve their effectiveness. Many thanks to:
